# Application for a Dehumidifier without Thinkering

## Motivation

My motivation for this project came from my need to hack my dehumifier (Delonghi DNC65) and give me remote control. I started looking at [Dehumidifier automator project](https://hackaday.io/project/20898-dehumidifier-automator#menu-description) and soon I decided I didn't wanted to tinker my device like it was done with this project. 

## Overview

This application it's largely based on [Shelly1](https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/shelly1) programming in JavaScript (Mongoose) applied on a ESP8266 on a Wemos D1 Minis board and a part of [bitlunis](https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/smart-washing-machine) code for handling a servo motor, is adapted.
